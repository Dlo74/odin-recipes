        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>A Krabby Patty seems like a typical sandwich at first. It's got a bunch of unsuspecting ingredients like a hamburger patty, cheese, lettuce, tomato, and more. But some people believe the actual secret ingredient is cocaine. When you Google the sandwich's recipe, some search results say to add a small amount of something called King Neptune's Poseidon Powder. Thats right, Cocaine, Cocaina like the colombians call it. Mr. Krabs is the underwater Chapo.</p>
